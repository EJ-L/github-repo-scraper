If thou lovest me then,\n+Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;\n+And in the wood, a league without the town,\n+Where I did meet thee once with Helena,\n+To do observance to a morn of May,\n+There will I stay for thee.\n+HERMIA\n+My good Lysander!\n+I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,\n+By his best arrow with the golden head,\n+By the simplicity of Venus' doves,\n+By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\n+And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,\n+When the false Troyan under sail was seen,\n+By all the vows that ever men have broke,\n+In number more than ever women spoke,\n+In that same place thou hast appointed me,\n+To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.\n+LYSANDER\n+Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\n+Enter HELENA\n+\n+HERMIA\n+God speed fair Helena! whither away?\n+HELENA\n+Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.\n+Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!\n+Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air\n+More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,\n+When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\n+Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,\n+Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;\n+My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\n+My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.\n+Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\n+The rest I'd give to be to you translated.\n+O, teach me how you look, and with what art\n+You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.\n+HERMIA\n+I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n+HELENA\n+O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\n+HERMIA\n+I give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n+HELENA\n+O that my prayers could such affection move!\n+HERMIA\n+The more I hate, the more he follows me.\n+HELENA\n+The more I love, the more he hateth me.\n+HERMIA\n+His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n+HELENA\n+None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!\n+HERMIA\n+Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;\n+Lysander and myself will fly this place.\n+Before the time I did Lysander see,\n+Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:\n+O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\n+That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!\n+LYSANDER\n+Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:\n+To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\n+Her silver visage in the watery glass,\n+Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,\n+A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,\n+Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.\n+HERMIA\n+And in the wood, where often you and I\n+Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,\n+Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\n+There my Lysander and myself shall meet;\n+And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\n+To seek new friends and stranger companies.\n+Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;\n+And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!\n+Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight\n+From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.\n+LYSANDER\n+I will, my Hermia.\n+Exit HERMIA\n+\n+Helena, adieu:\n+As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\n+Exit\n+\n+HELENA\n+How happy some o'er other some can be!\n+Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.\n+But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\n+He will not know what all but he do know:\n+And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,\n+So I, admiring of his qualities:\n+Things base and vile, folding no quantity,\n+Love can transpose to form and dignity:\n+Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\n+And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:\n+Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;\n+Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:\n+And therefore is Love said to be a child,\n+Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.\n+As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\n+So the boy Love is perjured every where:\n+For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,\n+He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;\n+And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\n+So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.\n+I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:\n+Then to the wood will he to-morrow night\n+Pursue her; and for this intelligence\n+If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:\n+But herein mean I to enrich my pain,\n+To have his sight thither and back again.\n+Exit\n+\n+SCENE II.

Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your\n+actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.\n+QUINCE\n+Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\n+BOTTOM\n+Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\n+QUINCE\n+You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\n+BOTTOM\n+What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?\n+QUINCE\n+A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.\n+BOTTOM\n+That will ask some tears in the true performing of\n+it: if I do it, let the audience look to their\n+eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some\n+measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a\n+tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to\n+tear a cat in, to make all split.\n+The raging rocks\n+And shivering shocks\n+Shall break the locks\n+Of prison gates;\n+And Phibbus' car\n+Shall shine from far\n+And make and mar\n+The foolish Fates.\n+This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.\n+This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is\n+more condoling.\n+QUINCE\n+Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.\n+FLUTE\n+Here, Peter Quince.\n+QUINCE\n+Flute, you must take Thisby on you.\n+FLUTE\n+What is Thisby? a wandering knight?\n+QUINCE\n+It is the lady that Pyramus must love.\n+FLUTE\n+Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.\n+QUINCE\n+That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and\n+you may speak as small as you will.\n+BOTTOM\n+An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll\n+speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,\n+Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,\n+and lady dear!'\n+QUINCE\n+No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.\n+BOTTOM\n+Well, proceed.\n+QUINCE\n+Robin Starveling, the tailor.\n+STARVELING\n+Here, Peter Quince.\n+QUINCE\n+Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.\n+Tom Snout, the tinker.\n+SNOUT\n+Here, Peter Quince.\n+QUINCE\n+You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:\n+Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I\n+hope, here is a play fitted.\n+SNUG\n+Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it\n+be, give it me, for I am slow of study.\n+QUINCE\n+You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\n+BOTTOM\n+Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will\n+do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,\n+that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,\n+let him roar again.'\n+QUINCE\n+An you should do it too terribly, you would fright\n+the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;\n+and that were enough to hang us all.\n+ALL\n+That would hang us, every mother's son.\n+BOTTOM\n+I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the\n+ladies out of their wits, they would have no more\n+discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my\n+voice so that I will roar you as gently as any\n+sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any\n+nightingale.\n+QUINCE\n+You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a\n+sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a\n+summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:\n+therefore you must needs play Pyramus.\n+BOTTOM\n+Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best\n+to play it in?\n+QUINCE\n+Why, what you will.\n+BOTTOM\n+I will discharge it in either your straw-colour\n+beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain\n+beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your\n+perfect yellow.\n+QUINCE\n+Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and\n+then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here\n+are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request\n+you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;\n+and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the\n+town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if\n+we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with\n+company, and our devices known. In the meantime I\n+will draw a bill of properties, such as our play\n+wants. I pray you, fail me not.\n+BOTTOM\n+We will meet; and there we may rehearse most\n+obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.\n+QUINCE\n+At the duke's oak we meet.\n+BOTTOM\n+Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.\n+Exeunt\n+\n+ACT II\n+SCENE I. A wood near Athens.\n+Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK\n+PUCK\n+How now, spirit! whither wander you?\n+Fairy\n+Over hill, over dale,\n+Thorough bush, thorough brier,\n+Over park, over pale,\n+Thorough flood, thorough fire,\n+I do wander everywhere,\n+Swifter than the moon's sphere;\n+And I serve the fairy queen,\n+To dew her orbs upon the green.\n+The cowslips tall her pensioners be:\n+In their gold coats spots you see;\n+Those be rubies, fairy favours,\n+In those freckles live their savours:\n+I must go seek some dewdrops here\n+And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.\n+Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:\n+Our queen and all our elves come here anon.\n+PUCK\n+The king doth keep his revels here to-night:\n+Take heed the queen come not within his sight;\n+For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,\n+Because that she as her attendant hath\n+A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;\n+She never had so sweet a changeling;\n+And jealous Oberon would have the child\n+Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;\n+But she perforce withholds the loved boy,\n+Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:\n+And now they never meet in grove or green,\n+By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,\n+But, they do square, that all their elves for fear\n+Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.\n+Fairy\n+Either I mistake your shape and making quite,\n+Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\n+Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he\n+That frights the maidens of the villagery;\n+Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern\n+And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;\n+And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;\n+Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?\n+Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,\n+You do their work, and they shall have good luck:\n+Are not you he?\n+PUCK\n+Thou speak'st aright;\n+I am that merry wanderer of the night.\n+I jest to Oberon and make him smile\n+When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\n+Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:\n+And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,\n+In very likeness of a roasted crab,\n+And when she drinks, against her lips I bob\n+And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.\n+The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\n+Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\n+Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,\n+And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;\n+And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,\n+And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear\n+A merrier hour was never wasted there.\n+But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.\n+Fairy\n+And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\n+Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers\n+\n+OBERON\n+Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n+TITANIA\n+What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:\n+I have forsworn his bed and company.\n+OBERON\n+Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?\n+TITANIA\n+Then I must be thy lady: but I know\n+When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,\n+And in the shape of Corin sat all day,\n+Playing on pipes of corn and versing love\n+To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\n+Come from the farthest Steppe of India?\n+But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\n+Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,\n+To Theseus must be wedded, and you come\n+To give their bed joy and prosperity.\n+OBERON\n+How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\n+Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,\n+Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?\n+Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night\n+From Perigenia, whom he ravished?\n+And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,\n+With Ariadne and Antiopa?\n+TITANIA\n+These are the forgeries of jealousy:\n+And never, since the middle summer's spring,\n+Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,\n+By paved fountain or by rushy brook,\n+Or in the beached margent of the sea,\n+To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\n+But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.\n+Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\n+As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea\n+Contagious fogs; which falling in the land\n+Have every pelting river made so proud\n+That they have overborne their continents:\n+The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,\n+The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn\n+Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;\n+The fold stands empty in the drowned field,\n+And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\n+The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,\n+And the quaint mazes in the wanton green\n+For lack of tread are undistinguishable:\n+The human mortals want their winter here;\n+No night is now with hymn or carol blest:\n+Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,\n+Pale in her anger, washes all the air,\n+That rheumatic diseases do abound:\n+And thorough this distemperature we see\n+The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\n+Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,\n+And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown\n+An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\n+Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,\n+The childing autumn, angry winter, change\n+Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,\n+By their increase, now knows not which is which:\n+And this same progeny of evils comes\n+From our debate, from our dissension;\n+We are their parents and original.\n+OBERON\n+Do you amend it then; it lies in you:\n+Why should Titania cross her Oberon?\n+I do but beg a little changeling boy,\n+To be my henchman.\n+TITANIA\n+Set your heart at rest:\n+The fairy land buys not the child of me.\n+His mother was a votaress of my order:\n+And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,\n+Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,\n+And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,\n+Marking the embarked traders on the flood,\n+When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive\n+And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\n+Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait\n+Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--\n+Would imitate, and sail upon the land,\n+To fetch me trifles, and return again,\n+As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\n+But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\n+And for her sake do I rear up her boy,\n+And for her sake I will not part with him.\n+OBERON\n+How long within this wood intend you stay?\n+TITANIA\n+Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.\n+If you will patiently dance in our round\n+And see our moonlight revels, go with us;\n+If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n+OBERON\n+Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.\n+TITANIA\n+Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!\n+We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.\n+Exit TITANIA with her train\n+\n+OBERON\n+Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove\n+Till I torment thee for this injury.\n+My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest\n+Since once I sat upon a promontory,\n+And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back\n+Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\n+That the rude sea grew civil at her song\n+And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,\n+To hear the sea-maid's music.\n+PUCK\n+I remember.\n+OBERON\n+That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,\n+Flying between the cold moon and the earth,\n+Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took\n+At a fair vestal throned by the west,\n+And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,\n+As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;\n+But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft\n+Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,\n+And the imperial votaress passed on,\n+In maiden meditation, fancy-free.\n+Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\n+It fell upon a little western flower,\n+Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,\n+And maidens call it love-in-idleness.\n+Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:\n+The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid\n+Will make or man or woman madly dote\n+Upon the next live creature that it sees.\n+Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again\n+Ere the leviathan can swim a league.\n+PUCK\n+I'll put a girdle round about the earth\n+In forty minutes.\n+Exit\n+\n+OBERON\n+Having once this juice,\n+I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,\n+And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.\n+The next thing then she waking looks upon,\n+Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\n+On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,\n+She shall pursue it with the soul of love:\n+And ere I take this charm from off her sight,\n+As I can take it with another herb,\n+I'll make her render up her page to me.\n+But who comes here? I am invisible;\n+And I will overhear their conference.\n+Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him\n+\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.\n+Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?\n+The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.\n+Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;\n+And here am I, and wode within this wood,\n+Because I cannot meet my Hermia.\n+Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\n+HELENA\n+You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;\n+But yet you draw not iron, for my heart\n+Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,\n+And I shall have no power to follow you.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?\n+Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth\n+Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?\n+HELENA\n+And even for that do I love you the more.\n+I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,\n+The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:\n+Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,\n+Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,\n+Unworthy as I am, to follow you.\n+What worser place can I beg in your love,--\n+And yet a place of high respect with me,--\n+Than to be used as you use your dog?\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;\n+For I am sick when I do look on thee.\n+HELENA\n+And I am sick when I look not on you.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+You do impeach your modesty too much,\n+To leave the city and commit yourself\n+Into the hands of one that loves you not;\n+To trust the opportunity of night\n+And the ill counsel of a desert place\n+With the rich worth of your virginity.\n+HELENA\n+Your virtue is my privilege: for that\n+It is not night when I do see your face,\n+Therefore I think I am not in the night;\n+Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,\n+For you in my respect are all the world:\n+Then how can it be said I am alone,\n+When all the world is here to look on me?\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,\n+And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\n+HELENA\n+The wildest hath not such a heart as you.\n+Run when you will, the story shall be changed:\n+Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;\n+The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind\n+Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,\n+When cowardice pursues and valour flies.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I will not stay thy questions; let me go:\n+Or, if thou follow me, do not believe\n+But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\n+HELENA\n+Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,\n+You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\n+Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:\n+We cannot fight for love, as men may do;\n+We should be wood and were not made to woo.\n+Exit DEMETRIUS\n+\n+I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,\n+To die upon the hand I love so well.\n+Exit\n+\n+OBERON\n+Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,\n+Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.\n+Re-enter PUCK\n+\n+Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.\n+PUCK\n+Ay, there it is.\n+OBERON\n+I pray thee, give it me.\n+I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\n+Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\n+Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\n+With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:\n+There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\n+Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;\n+And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,\n+Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:\n+And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,\n+And make her full of hateful fantasies.\n+Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:\n+A sweet Athenian lady is in love\n+With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;\n+But do it when the next thing he espies\n+May be the lady: thou shalt know the man\n+By the Athenian garments he hath on.\n+Effect it with some care, that he may prove\n+More fond on her than she upon her love:\n+And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.\n+PUCK\n+Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.\n+Exeunt\n+\n+SCENE II. Another part of the wood.\n+Enter TITANIA, with her train\n+TITANIA\n+Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;\n+Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;\n+Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,\n+Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,\n+To make my small elves coats, and some keep back\n+The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders\n+At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;\n+Then to your offices and let me rest.\n+The Fairies sing\n+\n+You spotted snakes with double tongue,\n+Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;\n+Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,\n+Come not near our fairy queen.\n+Philomel, with melody\n+Sing in our sweet lullaby;\n+Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:\n+Never harm,\n+Nor spell nor charm,\n+Come our lovely lady nigh;\n+So, good night, with lullaby.\n+Weaving spiders, come not here;\n+Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!\n+Beetles black, approach not near;\n+Worm nor snail, do no offence.\n+Philomel, with melody, & c.\n+Fairy\n+Hence, away! now all is well:\n+One aloof stand sentinel.\n+Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps\n+\n+Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids\n+\n+OBERON\n+What thou seest when thou dost wake,\n+Do it for thy true-love take,\n+Love and languish for his sake:\n+Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,\n+Pard, or boar with bristled hair,\n+In thy eye that shall appear\n+When thou wakest, it is thy dear:\n+Wake when some vile thing is near.\n+Exit\n+\n+Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA\n+\n+LYSANDER\n+Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;\n+And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:\n+We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,\n+And tarry for the comfort of the day.\n+HERMIA\n+Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;\n+For I upon this bank will rest my head.\n+LYSANDER\n+One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;\n+One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.\n+HERMIA\n+Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,\n+Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.\n+LYSANDER\n+O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!\n+Love takes the meaning in love's conference.\n+I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit\n+So that but one heart we can make of it;\n+Two bosoms interchained with an oath;\n+So then two bosoms and a single troth.\n+Then by your side no bed-room me deny;\n+For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.\n+HERMIA\n+Lysander riddles very prettily:\n+Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,\n+If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.\n+But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy\n+Lie further off; in human modesty,\n+Such separation as may well be said\n+Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,\n+So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:\n+Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!\n+LYSANDER\n+Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;\n+And then end life when I end loyalty!\n+Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!\n+HERMIA\n+With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!\n+They sleep\n+\n+Enter PUCK\n+\n+PUCK\n+Through the forest have I gone.\n+But Athenian found I none,\n+On whose eyes I might approve\n+This flower's force in stirring love.\n+Night and silence.--Who is here?\n+Weeds of Athens he doth wear:\n+This is he, my master said,\n+Despised the Athenian maid;\n+And here the maiden, sleeping sound,\n+On the dank and dirty ground.\n+Pretty soul! she durst not lie\n+Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.\n+Churl, upon thy eyes I throw\n+All the power this charm doth owe.\n+When thou wakest, let love forbid\n+Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:\n+So awake when I am gone;\n+For I must now to Oberon.\n+Exit\n+\n+Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running\n+\n+HELENA\n+Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.\n+HELENA\n+O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.\n+Exit\n+\n+HELENA\n+O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!\n+The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.\n+Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;\n+For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.\n+How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:\n+If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.\n+No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;\n+For beasts that meet me run away for fear:\n+Therefore no marvel though Demetrius\n+Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.\n+What wicked and dissembling glass of mine\n+Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?\n+But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!\n+Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.\n+Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.\n+LYSANDER\n+[Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.\n+Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,\n+That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.\n+Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word\n+Is that vile name to perish on my sword!\n+HELENA\n+Do not say so, Lysander; say not so\n+What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?\n+Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.\n+LYSANDER\n+Content with Hermia! No; I do repent\n+The tedious minutes I with her have spent.\n+Not Hermia but Helena I love:\n+Who will not change a raven for a dove?\n+The will of man is by his reason sway'd;\n+And reason says you are the worthier maid.\n+Things growing are not ripe until their season\n+So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;\n+And touching now the point of human skill,\n+Reason becomes the marshal to my will\n+And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook\n+Love's stories written in love's richest book.\n+HELENA\n+Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?\n+When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?\n+Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,\n+That I did never, no, nor never can,\n+Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,\n+But you must flout my insufficiency?\n+Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,\n+In such disdainful manner me to woo.\n+But fare you well: perforce I must confess\n+I thought you lord of more true gentleness.\n+O, that a lady, of one man refused.\n+Should of another therefore be abused!\n+Exit\n+\n+LYSANDER\n+She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:\n+And never mayst thou come Lysander near!\n+For as a surfeit of the sweetest things\n+The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,\n+Or as tie heresies that men do leave\n+Are hated most of those they did deceive,\n+So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,\n+Of all be hated, but the most of me!\n+And, all my powers, address your love and might\n+To honour Helen and to be her knight!\n+Exit\n+\n+HERMIA\n+[Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best\n+To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!\n+Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!\n+Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:\n+Methought a serpent eat my heart away,\n+And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.\n+Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!\n+What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?\n+Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;\n+Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.\n+No? then I well perceive you all not nigh\n+Either death or you I'll find immediately.\n+Exit\n+\n+ACT III\n+SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.\n+Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING\n+BOTTOM\n+Are we all met?\n+QUINCE\n+Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place\n+for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our\n+stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we\n+will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.\n+BOTTOM\n+Peter Quince,--\n+QUINCE\n+What sayest thou, bully Bottom?\n+BOTTOM\n+There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and\n+Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must\n+draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies\n+cannot abide. How answer you that?\n+SNOUT\n+By'r lakin, a parlous fear.\n+STARVELING\n+I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\n+BOTTOM\n+Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.\n+Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to\n+say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that\n+Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more\n+better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not\n+Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them\n+out of fear.\n+QUINCE\n+Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be\n+written in eight and six.\n+BOTTOM\n+No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\n+SNOUT\n+Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\n+STARVELING\n+I fear it, I promise you.\n+BOTTOM\n+Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to\n+bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a\n+most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful\n+wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to\n+look to 't.\n+SNOUT\n+Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\n+BOTTOM\n+Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must\n+be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself\n+must speak through, saying thus, or to the same\n+defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish\n+You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would\n+entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life\n+for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it\n+were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a\n+man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name\n+his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\n+QUINCE\n+Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;\n+that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,\n+you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.\n+SNOUT\n+Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?\n+BOTTOM\n+A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find\n+out moonshine, find out moonshine.\n+QUINCE\n+Yes, it doth shine that night.\n+BOTTOM\n+Why, then may you leave a casement of the great\n+chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon\n+may shine in at the casement.\n+QUINCE\n+Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns\n+and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to\n+present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is\n+another thing: we must have a wall in the great\n+chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did\n+talk through the chink of a wall.\n+SNOUT\n+You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?\n+BOTTOM\n+Some man or other must present Wall: and let him\n+have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast\n+about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his\n+fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus\n+and Thisby whisper.\n+QUINCE\n+If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,\n+every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.\n+Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your\n+speech, enter into that brake: and so every one\n+according to his cue.\n+Enter PUCK behind\n+\n+PUCK\n+What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,\n+So near the cradle of the fairy queen?\n+What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;\n+An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.\n+QUINCE\n+Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.\n+BOTTOM\n+Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--\n+QUINCE\n+Odours, odours.\n+BOTTOM\n+--odours savours sweet:\n+So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.\n+But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,\n+And by and by I will to thee appear.\n+Exit\n+\n+PUCK\n+A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.\n+Exit\n+\n+FLUTE\n+Must I speak now?\n+QUINCE\n+Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes\n+but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.\n+FLUTE\n+Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,\n+Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,\n+Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,\n+As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,\n+I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.\n+QUINCE\n+'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that\n+yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your\n+part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue\n+is past; it is, 'never tire.'\n+FLUTE\n+O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would\n+never tire.\n+Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head\n+\n+BOTTOM\n+If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.\n+QUINCE\n+O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,\n+masters! fly, masters! Help!\n+Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING\n+\n+PUCK\n+I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,\n+Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:\n+Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,\n+A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;\n+And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,\n+Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.\n+Exit\n+\n+BOTTOM\n+Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to\n+make me afeard.\n+Re-enter SNOUT\n+\n+SNOUT\n+O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?\n+BOTTOM\n+What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do\n+you?\n+Exit SNOUT\n+\n+Re-enter QUINCE\n+\n+QUINCE\n+Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art\n+translated.\n+Exit\n+\n+BOTTOM\n+I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;\n+to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir\n+from this place, do what they can: I will walk up\n+and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear\n+I am not afraid.\n+Sings\n+\n+The ousel cock so black of hue,\n+With orange-tawny bill,\n+The throstle with his note so true,\n+The wren with little quill,--\n+TITANIA\n+[Awaking] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?\n+BOTTOM\n+[Sings]\n+The finch, the sparrow and the lark,\n+The plain-song cuckoo gray,\n+Whose note full many a man doth mark,\n+And dares not answer nay;--\n+for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish\n+a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry\n+'cuckoo' never so?\n+TITANIA\n+I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:\n+Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;\n+So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;\n+And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me\n+On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.\n+BOTTOM\n+Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason\n+for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and\n+love keep little company together now-a-days; the\n+more the pity that some honest neighbours will not\n+make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.\n+TITANIA\n+Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.\n+BOTTOM\n+Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out\n+of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.\n+TITANIA\n+Out of this wood do not desire to go:\n+Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.\n+I am a spirit of no common rate;\n+The summer still doth tend upon my state;\n+And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;\n+I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,\n+And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,\n+And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;\n+And I will purge thy mortal grossness so\n+That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.\n+Peaseblossom!

Another part of the wood.\n+Enter OBERON\n+OBERON\n+I wonder if Titania be awaked;\n+Then, what it was that next came in her eye,\n+Which she must dote on in extremity.\n+Enter PUCK\n+\n+Here comes my messenger.\n+How now, mad spirit!\n+What night-rule now about this haunted grove?\n+PUCK\n+My mistress with a monster is in love.\n+Near to her close and consecrated bower,\n+While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,\n+A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\n+That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,\n+Were met together to rehearse a play\n+Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.\n+The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,\n+Who Pyramus presented, in their sport\n+Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake\n+When I did him at this advantage take,\n+An ass's nole I fixed on his head:\n+Anon his Thisbe must be answered,\n+And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,\n+As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,\n+Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,\n+Rising and cawing at the gun's report,\n+Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,\n+So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;\n+And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;\n+He murder cries and help from Athens calls.\n+Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears\n+thus strong,\n+Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;\n+For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;\n+Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all\n+things catch.\n+I led them on in this distracted fear,\n+And left sweet Pyramus translated there:\n+When in that moment, so it came to pass,\n+Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.\n+OBERON\n+This falls out better than I could devise.\n+But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes\n+With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?\n+PUCK\n+I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--\n+And the Athenian woman by his side:\n+That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.\n+Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS\n+\n+OBERON\n+Stand close: this is the same Athenian.\n+PUCK\n+This is the woman, but not this the man.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?\n+Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.\n+HERMIA\n+Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,\n+For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,\n+If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,\n+Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,\n+And kill me too.\n+The sun was not so true unto the day\n+As he to me: would he have stolen away\n+From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon\n+This whole earth may be bored and that the moon\n+May through the centre creep and so displease\n+Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.\n+It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;\n+So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+So should the murder'd look, and so should I,\n+Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:\n+Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,\n+As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.\n+HERMIA\n+What's this to my Lysander? where is he?\n+Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.\n+HERMIA\n+Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds\n+Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?\n+Henceforth be never number'd among men!\n+O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!\n+Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,\n+And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!\n+Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?\n+An adder did it; for with doubler tongue\n+Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+You spend your passion on a misprised mood:\n+I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;\n+Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.\n+HERMIA\n+I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+An if I could, what should I get therefore?\n+HERMIA\n+A privilege never to see me more.\n+And from thy hated presence part I so:\n+See me no more, whether he be dead or no.\n+Exit\n+\n+DEMETRIUS\n+There is no following her in this fierce vein:\n+Here therefore for a while I will remain.\n+So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow\n+For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:\n+Which now in some slight measure it will pay,\n+If for his tender here I make some stay.\n+Lies down and sleeps\n+\n+OBERON\n+What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite\n+And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:\n+Of thy misprision must perforce ensue\n+Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.\n+PUCK\n+Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,\n+A million fail, confounding oath on oath.\n+OBERON\n+About the wood go swifter than the wind,\n+And Helena of Athens look thou find:\n+All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,\n+With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:\n+By some illusion see thou bring her here:\n+I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.\n+PUCK\n+I go, I go; look how I go,\n+Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.\n+Exit\n+\n+OBERON\n+Flower of this purple dye,\n+Hit with Cupid's archery,\n+Sink in apple of his eye.\n+When his love he doth espy,\n+Let her shine as gloriously\n+As the Venus of the sky.\n+When thou wakest, if she be by,\n+Beg of her for remedy.\n+Re-enter PUCK\n+\n+PUCK\n+Captain of our fairy band,\n+Helena is here at hand;\n+And the youth, mistook by me,\n+Pleading for a lover's fee.\n+Shall we their fond pageant see?\n+Lord, what fools these mortals be!\n+OBERON\n+Stand aside: the noise they make\n+Will cause Demetrius to awake.\n+PUCK\n+Then will two at once woo one;\n+That must needs be sport alone;\n+And those things do best please me\n+That befal preposterously.\n+Enter LYSANDER and HELENA\n+\n+LYSANDER\n+Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?\n+Scorn and derision never come in tears:\n+Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,\n+In their nativity all truth appears.\n+How can these things in me seem scorn to you,\n+Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?\n+HELENA\n+You do advance your cunning more and more.\n+When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!\n+These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?\n+Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:\n+Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,\n+Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.\n+LYSANDER\n+I had no judgment when to her I swore.\n+HELENA\n+Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.\n+LYSANDER\n+Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+[Awaking] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!\n+To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?\n+Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show\n+Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!\n+That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,\n+Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow\n+When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss\n+This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!\n+HELENA\n+O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent\n+To set against me for your merriment:\n+If you we re civil and knew courtesy,\n+You would not do me thus much injury.\n+Can you not hate me, as I know you do,\n+But you must join in souls to mock me too?\n+If you were men, as men you are in show,\n+You would not use a gentle lady so;\n+To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,\n+When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.\n+You both are rivals, and love Hermia;\n+And now both rivals, to mock Helena:\n+A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,\n+To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes\n+With your derision! none of noble sort\n+Would so offend a virgin, and extort\n+A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.\n+LYSANDER\n+You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;\n+For you love Hermia; this you know I know:\n+And here, with all good will, with all my heart,\n+In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;\n+And yours of Helena to me bequeath,\n+Whom I do love and will do till my death.\n+HELENA\n+Never did mockers waste more idle breath.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:\n+If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.\n+My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,\n+And now to Helen is it home return'd,\n+There to remain.\n+LYSANDER\n+Helen, it is not so.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,\n+Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.\n+Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.\n+Re-enter HERMIA\n+\n+HERMIA\n+Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,\n+The ear more quick of apprehension makes;\n+Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\n+It pays the hearing double recompense.\n+Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;\n+Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound\n+But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\n+LYSANDER\n+Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?\n+HERMIA\n+What love could press Lysander from my side?\n+LYSANDER\n+Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,\n+Fair Helena, who more engilds the night\n+Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.\n+Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,\n+The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?\n+HERMIA\n+You speak not as you think: it cannot be.\n+HELENA\n+Lo, she is one of this confederacy!\n+Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three\n+To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.\n+Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!\n+Have you conspired, have you with these contrived\n+To bait me with this foul derision?\n+Is all the counsel that we two have shared,\n+The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,\n+When we have chid the hasty-footed time\n+For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?\n+All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?\n+We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,\n+Have with our needles created both one flower,\n+Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\n+Both warbling of one song, both in one key,\n+As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,\n+Had been incorporate. So we grow together,\n+Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,\n+But yet an union in partition;\n+Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;\n+So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;\n+Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,\n+Due but to one and crowned with one crest.\n+And will you rent our ancient love asunder,\n+To join with men in scorning your poor friend?\n+It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:\n+Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\n+Though I alone do feel the injury.\n+HERMIA\n+I am amazed at your passionate words.\n+I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.\n+HELENA\n+Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,\n+To follow me and praise my eyes and face?\n+And made your other love, Demetrius,\n+Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,\n+To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,\n+Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\n+To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander\n+Deny your love, so rich within his soul,\n+And tender me, forsooth, affection,\n+But by your setting on, by your consent?\n+What thought I be not so in grace as you,\n+So hung upon with love, so fortunate,\n+But miserable most, to love unloved?\n+This you should pity rather than despise.\n+HERNIA\n+I understand not what you mean by this.\n+HELENA\n+Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,\n+Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;\n+Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:\n+This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\n+If you have any pity, grace, or manners,\n+You would not make me such an argument.\n+But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;\n+Which death or absence soon shall remedy.\n+LYSANDER\n+Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:\n+My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!\n+HELENA\n+O excellent!\n+HERMIA\n+Sweet, do not scorn her so.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+If she cannot entreat, I can compel.\n+LYSANDER\n+Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:\n+Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.\n+Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:\n+I swear by that which I will lose for thee,\n+To prove him false that says I love thee not.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I say I love thee more than he can do.\n+LYSANDER\n+If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Quick, come!\n+HERMIA\n+Lysander, whereto tends all this?\n+LYSANDER\n+Away, you Ethiope!\n+DEMETRIUS\n+No, no; he'll [ ]\n+Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,\n+But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!\n+LYSANDER\n+Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,\n+Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!\n+HERMIA\n+Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?\n+Sweet love,--\n+LYSANDER\n+Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!\n+Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!\n+HERMIA\n+Do you not jest?\n+HELENA\n+Yes, sooth; and so do you.\n+LYSANDER\n+Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+I would I had your bond, for I perceive\n+A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.\n+LYSANDER\n+What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?\n+Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.\n+HERMIA\n+What, can you do me greater harm than hate?\n+Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!\n+Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?\n+I am as fair now as I was erewhile.\n+Since night you loved me; yet since night you left\n+me:\n+Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--\n+In earnest, shall I say?\n+LYSANDER\n+Ay, by my life;\n+And never did desire to see thee more.\n+Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;\n+Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest\n+That I do hate thee and love Helena.\n+HERMIA\n+O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!\n+You thief of love! what, have you come by night\n+And stolen my love's heart from him?\n+HELENA\n+Fine, i'faith!\n+Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,\n+No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear\n+Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?\n+Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!\n+HERMIA\n+Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.\n+Now I perceive that she hath made compare\n+Between our statures; she hath urged her height;\n+And with her personage, her tall personage,\n+Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.\n+And are you grown so high in his esteem;\n+Because I am so dwarfish and so low?\n+How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;\n+How low am I?

Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?\n+COBWEB\n+Ready.\n+BOTTOM\n+Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your\n+weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped\n+humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good\n+mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret\n+yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,\n+good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;\n+I would be loath to have you overflown with a\n+honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?\n+MUSTARDSEED\n+Ready.\n+BOTTOM\n+Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,\n+leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.\n+MUSTARDSEED\n+What's your Will?\n+BOTTOM\n+Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb\n+to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for\n+methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I\n+am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,\n+I must scratch.\n+TITANIA\n+What, wilt thou hear some music,\n+my sweet love?\n+BOTTOM\n+I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have\n+the tongs and the bones.\n+TITANIA\n+Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.\n+BOTTOM\n+Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good\n+dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle\n+of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.\n+TITANIA\n+I have a venturous fairy that shall seek\n+The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.\n+BOTTOM\n+I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.\n+But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I\n+have an exposition of sleep come upon me.\n+TITANIA\n+Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.\n+Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.\n+Exeunt fairies\n+\n+So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle\n+Gently entwist; the female ivy so\n+Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.\n+O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!\n+They sleep\n+\n+Enter PUCK\n+\n+OBERON\n+[Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.\n+See'st thou this sweet sight?\n+Her dotage now I do begin to pity:\n+For, meeting her of late behind the wood,\n+Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,\n+I did upbraid her and fall out with her;\n+For she his hairy temples then had rounded\n+With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;\n+And that same dew, which sometime on the buds\n+Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,\n+Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes\n+Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.\n+When I had at my pleasure taunted her\n+And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,\n+I then did ask of her her changeling child;\n+Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent\n+To bear him to my bower in fairy land.\n+And now I have the boy, I will undo\n+This hateful imperfection of her eyes:\n+And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp\n+From off the head of this Athenian swain;\n+That, he awaking when the other do,\n+May all to Athens back again repair\n+And think no more of this night's accidents\n+But as the fierce vexation of a dream.\n+But first I will release the fairy queen.\n+Be as thou wast wont to be;\n+See as thou wast wont to see:\n+Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower\n+Hath such force and blessed power.\n+Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.\n+TITANIA\n+My Oberon! what visions have I seen!\n+Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.\n+OBERON\n+There lies your love.\n+TITANIA\n+How came these things to pass?\n+O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!\n+OBERON\n+Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.\n+Titania, music call; and strike more dead\n+Than common sleep of all these five the sense.\n+TITANIA\n+Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!\n+Music, still\n+\n+PUCK\n+Now, when thou wakest, with thine\n+own fool's eyes peep.\n+OBERON\n+Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,\n+And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\n+Now thou and I are new in amity,\n+And will to-morrow midnight solemnly\n+Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,\n+And bless it to all fair prosperity:\n+There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be\n+Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.\n+PUCK\n+Fairy king, attend, and mark:\n+I do hear the morning lark.\n+OBERON\n+Then, my queen, in silence sad,\n+Trip we after the night's shade:\n+We the globe can compass soon,\n+Swifter than the wandering moon.\n+TITANIA\n+Come, my lord, and in our flight\n+Tell me how it came this night\n+That I sleeping here was found\n+With these mortals on the ground.\n+Exeunt\n+\n+Horns winded within\n+\n+Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train\n+\n+THESEUS\n+Go, one of you, find out the forester;\n+For now our observation is perform'd;\n+And since we have the vaward of the day,\n+My love shall hear the music of my hounds.\n+Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:\n+Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.\n+Exit an Attendant\n+\n+We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,\n+And mark the musical confusion\n+Of hounds and echo in conjunction.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,\n+When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear\n+With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear\n+Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,\n+The skies, the fountains, every region near\n+Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard\n+So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\n+THESEUS\n+My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\n+So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung\n+With ears that sweep away the morning dew;\n+Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;\n+Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,\n+Each under each. A cry more tuneable\n+Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,\n+In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:\n+Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?\n+EGEUS\n+My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;\n+And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;\n+This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:\n+I wonder of their being here together.\n+THESEUS\n+No doubt they rose up early to observe\n+The rite of May, and hearing our intent,\n+Came here in grace our solemnity.\n+But speak, Egeus; is not this the day\n+That Hermia should give answer of her choice?\n+EGEUS\n+It is, my lord.\n+THESEUS\n+Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\n+Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up\n+\n+Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:\n+Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?\n+LYSANDER\n+Pardon, my lord.\n+THESEUS\n+I pray you all, stand up.\n+I know you two are rival enemies:\n+How comes this gentle concord in the world,\n+That hatred is so far from jealousy,\n+To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?\n+LYSANDER\n+My lord, I shall reply amazedly,\n+Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,\n+I cannot truly say how I came here;\n+But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,\n+And now do I bethink me, so it is,--\n+I came with Hermia hither: our intent\n+Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,\n+Without the peril of the Athenian law.\n+EGEUS\n+Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:\n+I beg the law, the law, upon his head.\n+They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,\n+Thereby to have defeated you and me,\n+You of your wife and me of my consent,\n+Of my consent that she should be your wife.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,\n+Of this their purpose hither to this wood;\n+And I in fury hither follow'd them,\n+Fair Helena in fancy following me.\n+But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--\n+But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,\n+Melted as the snow, seems to me now\n+As the remembrance of an idle gaud\n+Which in my childhood I did dote upon;\n+And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,\n+The object and the pleasure of mine eye,\n+Is only Helena. To her, my lord,\n+Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:\n+But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;\n+But, as in health, come to my natural taste,\n+Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,\n+And will for evermore be true to it.\n+THESEUS\n+Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:\n+Of this discourse we more will hear anon.\n+Egeus, I will overbear your will;\n+For in the temple by and by with us\n+These couples shall eternally be knit:\n+And, for the morning now is something worn,\n+Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.\n+Away with us to Athens; three and three,\n+We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.\n+Come, Hippolyta.\n+Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train\n+\n+DEMETRIUS\n+These things seem small and undistinguishable,\n+HERMIA\n+Methinks I see these things with parted eye,\n+When every thing seems double.\n+HELENA\n+So methinks:\n+And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\n+Mine own, and not mine own.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Are you sure\n+That we are awake? It seems to me\n+That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think\n+The duke was here, and bid us follow him?\n+HERMIA\n+Yea; and my father.\n+HELENA\n+And Hippolyta.\n+LYSANDER\n+And he did bid us follow to the temple.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him\n+And by the way let us recount our dreams.\n+Exeunt\n+\n+BOTTOM\n+[Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will\n+answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!\n+Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,\n+the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen\n+hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare\n+vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to\n+say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go\n+about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there\n+is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and\n+methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if\n+he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye\n+of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not\n+seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue\n+to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream\n+was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of\n+this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,\n+because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the\n+latter end of a play, before the duke:\n+peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall\n+sing it at her death.\n+Exit\n+\n+SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.\n+Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING\n+QUINCE\n+Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?\n+STARVELING\n+He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is\n+transported.\n+FLUTE\n+If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes\n+not forward, doth it?\n+QUINCE\n+It is not possible: you have not a man in all\n+Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.\n+FLUTE\n+No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft\n+man in Athens.\n+QUINCE\n+Yea and the best person too; and he is a very\n+paramour for a sweet voice.\n+FLUTE\n+You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,\n+a thing of naught.\n+Enter SNUG\n+\n+SNUG\n+Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and\n+there is two or three lords and ladies more married:\n+if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made\n+men.\n+FLUTE\n+O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a\n+day during his life; he could not have 'scaped\n+sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him\n+sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;\n+he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in\n+Pyramus, or nothing.\n+Enter BOTTOM\n+\n+BOTTOM\n+Where are these lads? where are these hearts?\n+QUINCE\n+Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!\n+BOTTOM\n+Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not\n+what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I\n+will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.\n+QUINCE\n+Let us hear, sweet Bottom.\n+BOTTOM\n+Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that\n+the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,\n+good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your\n+pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look\n+o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our\n+play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have\n+clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion\n+pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the\n+lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions\n+nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I\n+do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet\n+comedy.

That you should here repent you,\n+The actors are at hand and by their show\n+You shall know all that you are like to know.\n+THESEUS\n+This fellow doth not stand upon points.\n+LYSANDER\n+He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows\n+not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not\n+enough to speak, but to speak true.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child\n+on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.\n+THESEUS\n+His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing\n+impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?\n+Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion\n+\n+Prologue\n+Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\n+But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\n+This man is Pyramus, if you would know;\n+This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.\n+This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present\n+Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;\n+And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content\n+To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.\n+This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,\n+Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,\n+By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\n+To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.\n+This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,\n+The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,\n+Did scare away, or rather did affright;\n+And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,\n+Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.\n+Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,\n+And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:\n+Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\n+He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;\n+And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,\n+His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\n+Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain\n+At large discourse, while here they do remain.\n+Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine\n+\n+THESEUS\n+I wonder if the lion be to speak.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.\n+Wall\n+In this same interlude it doth befall\n+That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;\n+And such a wall, as I would have you think,\n+That had in it a crannied hole or chink,\n+Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,\n+Did whisper often very secretly.\n+This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show\n+That I am that same wall; the truth is so:\n+And this the cranny is, right and sinister,\n+Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\n+THESEUS\n+Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?\n+DEMETRIUS\n+It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard\n+discourse, my lord.\n+Enter Pyramus\n+\n+THESEUS\n+Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!\n+Pyramus\n+O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!\n+O night, which ever art when day is not!\n+O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,\n+I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!\n+And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\n+That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!\n+Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\n+Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!\n+Wall holds up his fingers\n+\n+Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!\n+But what see I? No Thisby do I see.\n+O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!\n+Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\n+THESEUS\n+The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\n+Pyramus\n+No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'\n+is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to\n+spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will\n+fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.\n+Enter Thisbe\n+\n+Thisbe\n+O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\n+For parting my fair Pyramus and me!\n+My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,\n+Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\n+Pyramus\n+I see a voice: now will I to the chink,\n+To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!\n+Thisbe\n+My love thou art, my love I think.\n+Pyramus\n+Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;\n+And, like Limander, am I trusty still.\n+Thisbe\n+And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.\n+Pyramus\n+Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\n+Thisbe\n+As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\n+Pyramus\n+O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!\n+Thisbe\n+I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.\n+Pyramus\n+Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?\n+Thisbe\n+'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.\n+Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe\n+\n+Wall\n+Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;\n+And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\n+Exit\n+\n+THESEUS\n+Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear\n+without warning.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\n+THESEUS\n+The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst\n+are no worse, if imagination amend them.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\n+THESEUS\n+If we imagine no worse of them than they of\n+themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here\n+come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.\n+Enter Lion and Moonshine\n+\n+Lion\n+You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear\n+The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,\n+May now perchance both quake and tremble here,\n+When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\n+Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am\n+A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;\n+For, if I should as lion come in strife\n+Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.\n+THESEUS\n+A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.\n+LYSANDER\n+This lion is a very fox for his valour.\n+THESEUS\n+True; and a goose for his discretion.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his\n+discretion; and the fox carries the goose.\n+THESEUS\n+His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;\n+for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:\n+leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.\n+Moonshine\n+This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--\n+DEMETRIUS\n+He should have worn the horns on his head.\n+THESEUS\n+He is no crescent, and his horns are\n+invisible within the circumference.\n+Moonshine\n+This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;\n+Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.\n+THESEUS\n+This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man\n+should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the\n+man i' the moon?\n+DEMETRIUS\n+He dares not come there for the candle; for, you\n+see, it is already in snuff.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!\n+THESEUS\n+It appears, by his small light of discretion, that\n+he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all\n+reason, we must stay the time.\n+LYSANDER\n+Proceed, Moon.\n+Moonshine\n+All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the\n+lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this\n+thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all\n+these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.\n+Enter Thisbe\n+\n+Thisbe\n+This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?\n+Lion\n+[Roaring] Oh--\n+Thisbe runs off\n+\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Well roared, Lion.\n+THESEUS\n+Well run, Thisbe.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a\n+good grace.\n+The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit\n+\n+THESEUS\n+Well moused, Lion.\n+LYSANDER\n+And so the lion vanished.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+And then came Pyramus.\n+Enter Pyramus\n+\n+Pyramus\n+Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;\n+I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;\n+For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,\n+I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.\n+But stay, O spite!\n+But mark, poor knight,\n+What dreadful dole is here!\n+Eyes, do you see?\n+How can it be?\n+O dainty duck! O dear!\n+Thy mantle good,\n+What, stain'd with blood!\n+Approach, ye Furies fell!\n+O Fates, come, come,\n+Cut thread and thrum;\n+Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!\n+THESEUS\n+This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would\n+go near to make a man look sad.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.\n+Pyramus\n+O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?\n+Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:\n+Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame\n+That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd\n+with cheer.\n+Come, tears, confound;\n+Out, sword, and wound\n+The pap of Pyramus;\n+Ay, that left pap,\n+Where heart doth hop:\n+Stabs himself\n+\n+Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.\n+Now am I dead,\n+Now am I fled;\n+My soul is in the sky:\n+Tongue, lose thy light;\n+Moon take thy flight:\n+Exit Moonshine\n+\n+Now die, die, die, die, die.\n+Dies\n+\n+DEMETRIUS\n+No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.\n+LYSANDER\n+Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.\n+THESEUS\n+With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and\n+prove an ass.\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes\n+back and finds her lover?\n+THESEUS\n+She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and\n+her passion ends the play.\n+Re-enter Thisbe\n+\n+HIPPOLYTA\n+Methinks she should not use a long one for such a\n+Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which\n+Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;\n+she for a woman, God bless us.\n+LYSANDER\n+She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+And thus she means, videlicet:--\n+Thisbe\n+Asleep, my love?\n+What, dead, my dove?\n+O Pyramus, arise!\n+Speak, speak. Quite dumb?\n+Dead, dead? A tomb\n+Must cover thy sweet eyes.\n+These My lips,\n+This cherry nose,\n+These yellow cowslip cheeks,\n+Are gone, are gone:\n+Lovers, make moan:\n+His eyes were green as leeks.\n+O Sisters Three,\n+Come, come to me,\n+With hands as pale as milk;\n+Lay them in gore,\n+Since you have shore\n+With shears his thread of silk.\n+Tongue, not a word:\n+Come, trusty sword;\n+Come, blade, my breast imbrue:\n+Stabs herself\n+\n+And, farewell, friends;\n+Thus Thisby ends:\n+Adieu, adieu, adieu.\n+Dies\n+\n+THESEUS\n+Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.\n+DEMETRIUS\n+Ay, and Wall too.\n+BOTTOM\n+[Starting up] No assure you; the wall is down that\n+parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the\n+epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two\n+of our company?\n+THESEUS\n+No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no\n+excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all\n+dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he\n+that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself\n+in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine\n+tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably\n+discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your\n+epilogue alone.\n+A dance\n+\n+The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:\n+Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.\n+I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn\n+As much as we this night have overwatch'd.\n+This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled\n+The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.\n+A fortnight hold we this solemnity,\n+In nightly revels and new jollity.\n+Exeunt\n+\n+Enter PUCK\n+\n+PUCK\n+Now the hungry lion roars,\n+And the wolf behowls the moon;\n+Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,\n+All with weary task fordone.\n+Now the wasted brands do glow,\n+Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,\n+Puts the wretch that lies in woe\n+In remembrance of a shroud.\n+Now it is the time of night\n+That the graves all gaping wide,\n+Every one lets forth his sprite,\n+In the church-way paths to glide:\n+And we fairies, that do run\n+By the triple Hecate's team,\n+From the presence of the sun,\n+Following darkness like a dream,\n+Now are frolic: not a mouse\n+Shall disturb this hallow'd house:\n+I am sent with broom before,\n+To sweep the dust behind the door.\n+Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train\n+\n+OBERON\n+Through the house give gathering light,\n+By the dead and drowsy fire:\n+Every elf and fairy sprite\n+Hop as light as bird from brier;\n+And this ditty, after me,\n+Sing, and dance it trippingly.\n+TITANIA\n+First, rehearse your song by rote\n+To each word a warbling note:\n+Hand in hand, with fairy grace,\n+Will we sing, and bless this place.\n+Song and dance\n+\n+OBERON\n+Now, until the break of day,\n+Through this house each fairy stray.\n+To the best bride-bed will we,\n+Which by us shall blessed be;\n+And the issue there create\n+Ever shall be fortunate.\n+So shall all the couples three\n+Ever true in loving be;\n+And the blots of Nature's hand\n+Shall not in their issue stand;\n+Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,\n+Nor mark prodigious, such as are\n+Despised in nativity,\n+Shall upon their children be.\n+With this field-dew consecrate,\n+Every fairy take his gait;\n+And each several chamber bless,\n+Through this palace, with sweet peace;\n+And the owner of it blest\n+Ever shall in safety rest.\n+Trip away; make no stay;\n+Meet me all by break of day.\n+Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train\n+\n+PUCK\n+If we shadows have offended,\n+Think but this, and all is mended,\n+That you have but slumber'd here\n+While these visions did appear.\n+And this weak and idle theme,\n+No more yielding but a dream,\n+Gentles, do not reprehend:\n+if you pardon, we will mend:\n+And, as I am an honest Puck,\n+If we have unearned luck\n+Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,\n+We will make amends ere long;\n+Else the Puck a liar call;\n+So, good night unto you all.\n+Give me your hands, if we be friends,\n+And Robin shall restore amends."
